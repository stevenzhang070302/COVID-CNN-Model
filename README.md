# COVID-CNN-Model
Demo using Convolutional Neural Networks to predict whether a patient has COVID, Pneumonia, or is healthy from X-ray images.

The dataset for this project can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets).

The COVID Classification CNN Workshop.ipynb file is the notebook containing all our code for using TensorFlow's layers package to construct a Convolutional Neural Network to predict whether a patient has COVID based on their X-ray image.
